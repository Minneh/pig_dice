# Description:
Pig is a very simple dice game that is exceptionally easy both to learn and to play. As a jeopardy dice game, it manages to keep players on the edge of their seat as they try to determine whether to risk it all or to play it safe. Pig can be played virtually anywhere; the only requirements are one (or two) standard six-sided die and something to keep score with, and, of course the players. The first person to score 100 points wins!

# Specifications:
Step 1:
Roll one die for your first turn. Playing with two dice is optional.

Step 2:
A roll of two, three, four, five, or six gains one the respective points. If you roll a one, you lose all the points you accumulated during that turn, and you lose your turn.

Step 3:
One can choose to "hold" which saves the points they have so far and shifts the turn to the other player.

Tip
Knowing when to stop rolling and end your turn is the key to winning at Pig. It's an exercise in deciding between gut instinct and greed.

Step 4:
Reach 100 points first and win the game.

Step 5:
To play with two dice, roll both for your first turn. If you roll a one on either die, you score zero for that turn and your turns ends, but if you roll two ones – or snake eyes – you lose your turn and all the points you've earned during the game.
